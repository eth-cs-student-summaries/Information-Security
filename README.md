# Information Security at ETH

This documents is a melange of a script and a simple list of definitions for the course
Information  Securityat ETH Zurich.  It contains lots of definitions,  a few explanations
here and there,  and – where applicable – even diagrams!  You won’t,  however,  find any
involved proofs or lots of examples.

This summary is created during the spring semester 2020.  
But due to the few changesin syllabus content in the past we have reason to believe that it is also relevant beyond
that very semester. 

We do not guarantee correctness or completeness, nor is this document endorsed by thelecturers.  
Feel free to point out any erratas.
